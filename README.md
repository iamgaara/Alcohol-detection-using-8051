step 1: Create a asm file using keil 
        The content to be written in the asm file is given in this repository in the form of a text file.
        and create the hex file.
        hex file generated in one computer cannot be used in a different computer.

step 2:Copy paste the library for gas sensor in the library folder of proteus
        In my case the library folder was hidden.
        Find the folder and paste it there.

step 3:Open proteus project.
      I have provided the project or the schematic in this repository.

step 4:Before loading the hex file into your 80c51 microcontroller.
        Make sure the gas sensor mq3 is set up properly
        right click on the gas sensor mq3 in the circuit and select properties.
        the file location of the library should be manually selected from the library folder where we copy pasted it earlier         in step 2.

step 5:load the hex code into your micro controller each time you simulate the circuit.

step 6: use the logic state device 0 and 1 to see the output.

step 7:if this don't work use Chatgpt or any ai for help.

step 8:for me the ai didn't worked well, so I referred youtube.

step 9:still any queries feel free to contact me: Instagram handle is "b066y.trolls"
